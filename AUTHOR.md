## Project Background

TalentScout Hiring Assistant was developed to address the challenges faced by recruiters and hiring managers in efficiently evaluating technical candidates. The system leverages advanced AI and natural language processing to create a dynamic, adaptive assessment platform.

### Project Motivation

The traditional hiring process often involves:
- Time-consuming manual resume screening
- Inconsistent interview questions across candidates
- Difficulty in objectively comparing candidate skills
- Limited scalability for high-volume hiring

TalentScout addresses these challenges by providing:
- Automated resume analysis and verification
- Dynamic question generation tailored to each candidate
- Objective scoring and evaluation
- Comprehensive reporting for hiring decisions

### Technical Approach

The project utilizes several innovative approaches:

1. **Adaptive Question Generation:** Questions are dynamically generated based on the candidate's tech stack, experience level, and previous responses, ensuring relevant and appropriately challenging assessments.

2. **Resume Consistency Analysis:** The system cross-references candidate claims with their resume content to identify discrepancies and validate technical expertise.

3. **Conversational AI Integration:** Powered by Llama 3.3 70B Versatile model through Groq API, providing contextually aware and intelligent interactions.

4. **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules for validation, assessment, reporting, and UI components.

### Key Innovations

- **Context-Aware Evaluation:** The system maintains conversation history to generate follow-up questions that probe deeper into specific areas.
- **Confidence-Based Progression:** Assessment difficulty adapts in real-time based on candidate performance.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Detailed feedback helps both candidates and recruiters understand strengths and areas for improvement.
